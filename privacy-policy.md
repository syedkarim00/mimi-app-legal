# Privacy Policy
**Effective:** 2025-01-01

**Who we are.** Mimi (“we”, “our”, “us”) builds tools to help two people find fair meeting spots.

**What we collect.**
- **User-entered addresses & search text** (sent to our proxy and then to Google Maps to fulfill your request). We do **not** create accounts.
- **Network metadata** (e.g., IP address) may be processed by our edge provider (Cloudflare) for security and rate-limiting.
- We do **not** use advertising SDKs. We do **not** sell personal data.

**How we use data.**
- To return place suggestions and routes via Google Maps Platform.
- To protect our service (abuse prevention, rate limits).

**Retention.**
- We do **not** persist addresses or queries on our servers beyond short-lived logs needed for security. Our logs are rotated and kept **≤ 24 hours** (target) unless needed to investigate abuse.

**Sharing.**
- With **Google Maps Platform** (as your service provider) to provide location results.
- With **Cloudflare** (as our edge provider) to deliver the service and mitigate abuse.

**Your choices.**
- You may avoid entering personal addresses; generic areas (e.g., “Union Station, Toronto”) work.
- Contact us to request deletion of any support emails you’ve sent.

**Children.** Not directed to children under 13.

**Contact.** privacy@mimiapp.example

We may update this policy; we’ll change the “Effective” date above.
